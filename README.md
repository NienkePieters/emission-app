![](https://github.com/NienkePieters/emission-app/blob/master/emission_app.gif)

About the app: 
- This app forecasts atmospheric CO2 by comparing 3 types of forecasting models, and has been built using Python and VIKTOR. 
- The 'actual values' data comes from the Mauna Loa CO2 dataset (a research facility that monitors the atmosphere). The data untill 2017 has been used as input data for the forecasts from 2017 onwards.
- It is based on the following article: https://towardsdatascience.com/forecasting-atmospheric-co2-concentration-with-python-c4a99e4cf142
